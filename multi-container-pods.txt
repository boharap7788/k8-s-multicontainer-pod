Multi-container pods in Kubernetes can be used for various purposes, each serving a specific function within the pod. Here are some common types of multi-container pods:

    Sidecar Pattern:
        Description: A sidecar is a secondary container that runs alongside the main application container. It enhances or extends the functionality of the main container without affecting its core logic.
        Use Cases: Logging, monitoring, data syncing, encryption, or proxying.

    Adapter Pattern:
        Description: An adapter container modifies or adapts the data presented by the main container to make it consumable by another component.
        Use Cases: Format conversion, translating logs, or transforming data.

    Ambassador Pattern:
        Description: An ambassador container is responsible for handling communication between the main container and external services. It acts as an intermediary for network communication.
        Use Cases: Proxying requests, handling network communication, or routing traffic.

    Init Container Pattern:
        Description: Init containers run before the main containers start. They are used to perform setup or initialization tasks, such as preparing data or waiting for a database to be ready.
        Use Cases: Database initialization, data pre-processing, or fetching configuration files.

    Helper Pattern:
        Description: A helper container provides utility functions or tools that assist the main container during its operation.
        Use Cases: Providing debugging tools, utilities for maintenance, or troubleshooting.

    Logging and Monitoring Pattern:
        Description: Multiple containers work together to collect, process, and export logs or metrics from the main application container.
        Use Cases: Centralized logging, metrics collection, or monitoring.

    Batch Processing Pattern:
        Description: Containers within the pod collaborate to perform batch processing tasks. Each container may have a specific role in the processing pipeline.
        Use Cases: Data processing pipelines, parallel batch processing, or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows.

    Adapter (Sidecar) with Ambassadors:
        Description: A combination of the adapter pattern and ambassador pattern where a sidecar container adapts or processes data, and an ambassador container handles external communication.
        Use Cases: Combining data processing and external communication responsibilities.
